  9. Pressure Converter (you already have this)
    - Add vacuum units like Torr, millimeters of
  mercury
  10. Force Converter
    - Newtons, pound-force, dynes, kilogram-force

    1. Data Storage Converter
    - Convert between bytes, kilobytes, megabytes,
  gigabytes, terabytes
    - Include both binary (1024-based) and decimal
  (1000-based) units
    - Useful for IT professionals and general users

    - Hz, KHz, MHz, GHz
    - Useful for networking and telecommunications
  6. Cooking Measurements Converter
    - Cups, tablespoons, teaspoons, milliliters, fluid
  ounces
    - Pounds, ounces, grams, kilograms (for solid
  ingredients)
    - Fahrenheit to Celsius (for oven temperatures)
    - Very practical for everyday use
  7. Torque Converter
    - Newton-meters, pound-feet, kilogram-meters
    - Used in engineering and automotive applications
  8. Radiation/Radioactivity Converter
    - Sieverts, rems, grays, rads
    - Becquerels, curies
    - Specialized but important for scientific and
  medical fields

  Would you like me to implement any of these
  converters next? The data storage and time converters
   would probably be the most widely useful to general
  users.
