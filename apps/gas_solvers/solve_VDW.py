"""
This code defines two functions vdW_EoS and vdW_EoS_solver. 
The vdW_EoS function calculates the residual function for the Van der Waals equation of state,
 while the vdW_EoS_solver function solves the Van der Waals equation of state for a mixture
 of components. 
The input parameters for the vdW_EoS_solver function include the temperature,
 pressure, and Van der Waals equation of state parameters a and b for each component.
 The function returns the molar volume that satisfies the Van der Waals equation
 of state for the given conditions.

To use the code, you would provide the necessary input parameters for the vdW_EoS_solver function
 and call the function.
 The function will then return the molar volume that satisfies the Van der Waals
 equation of state for the given conditions. It is important to note that the Van der Waals 
equation of state parameters a and b need to be calculated beforehand 
using methods such as regression analysis or the modified corresponding states (MCS) method.

In this code, the root function from the scipy.optimize module is used to solve for the 
molar volume that satisfies the Van der Waals equation of state. 
The root function uses a numerical method to find the root of a function, in this case, 
the residual function for the Van der Waals equation of state. 
The V0 value is set as the initial estimate for the molar volume and is 
calculated as the molar volume that would correspond to an ideal gas at the given temperature 
and pressure. The V value returned by the root function is the molar volume that satisfies
 the Van der Waals equation of state for the given conditions.
