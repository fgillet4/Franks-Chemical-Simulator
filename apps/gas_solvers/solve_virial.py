"""
This code defines two functions virial_EoS and virial_EoS_solver. The virial_EoS function calculates the residual function for the Virial equation of state, while the virial_EoS_solver function solves the Virial equation of state for a mixture of components. The input parameters for the virial_EoS_solver function include the temperature, pressure, and second and third virial coefficients B and C for each component. The function returns the molar volume that satisfies the Virial equation of state for the given conditions.

To use the code, you would provide the necessary input parameters for the virial_EoS_solver function and call the function. The function will then return the molar volume that satisfies the Virial equation of state for the given conditions. It is important to note that the virial coefficients B and C need to be calculated beforehand using methods such as regression analysis or experimental data.
In this code, the root function from the scipy.optimize module is used to solve for the molar volume that satisfies the Virial equation of state. The root function uses a numerical method to find the root of a function, in this case, the residual function for the Virial equation of state. The V0 value is set as the initial estimate for the molar volume and is calculated as the molar volume that would correspond to an ideal gas at the given temperature and pressure. The V value returned by the root function is the molar volume that satisfies the Virial equation of state for the given conditions.

It is important to note that the Virial equation of state is a simplified model that only considers the first three terms in the virial expansion. The higher order terms in the virial expansion become increasingly important at higher pressures and lower temperatures. As a result, the Virial equation of state is only applicable for a limited range of conditions and may not provide accurate results for all systems.
